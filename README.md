# GCN4MOL

GCN4MOL is a project that demonstrates how to use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for molecular property prediction. The repository contains three main scripts: `smiles2graph.py`, `train_gcn.py`, and `test_gcn.py`. These scripts are used to convert SMILES strings to graph data, train a GCN model, and evaluate the model's performance, respectively.

## Overview

1. **smiles2graph.py**: This script converts SMILES strings into graph data objects using RDKit and PyTorch Geometric. Each molecule is represented as a graph where atoms are nodes, and bonds are edges. The script also handles feature extraction for each atom.

2. **train_gcn.py**: This script trains a simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model using the graph data objects generated from `smiles2graph.py`. The model is trained to predict molecular properties, and the training process includes data loading, model initialization, loss computation, and optimization.

3. **test_gcn.py**: This script evaluates the trained GCN model on a test dataset. It computes performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score and generates a scatter plot comparing actual versus predicted values.

## File Descriptions

### smiles2graph.py

This script converts SMILES strings into graph data objects. Key functionalities include:

- **Atom Feature Extraction**: Extracts features for each atom, such as atom type, degree, formal charge, hybridization, aromaticity, atomic mass, van der Waals radius, covalent radius, chirality, and hydrogen count.
- **Graph Creation**: Creates graph data objects from SMILES strings, including atom features and edge indices.
- **Data Saving**: Saves the generated graph data objects to a file for later use.

### train_gcn.py

This script trains a GCN model using the graph data objects. Key functionalities include:

- **Model Definition**: Defines a simple GCN model with two GCN layers and a linear output layer.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the graph data objects and splits them into training and testing datasets.
- **Training Process**: Trains the GCN model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model to a file for later use.

### test_gcn.py

This script evaluates the trained GCN model on a test dataset. Key functionalities include:

- **Model Loading**: Loads the trained GCN model and ensures it is in evaluation mode.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the test dataset for evaluation.
- **Prediction and Evaluation**: Makes predictions using the GCN model, collects actual and predicted values, and computes performance metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plots a scatter plot comparing actual versus predicted values, including a diagonal line representing perfect predictions.
